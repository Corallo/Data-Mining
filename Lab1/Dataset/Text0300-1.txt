Madrid overcame a spirited display from Valencia to claim their place in the last four of the Copa del Rey with a 5-1 aggregate win.
  	With the clubs tied at 1-1 after the opening match at the Nou Camp, Pedro gave Real a ninth-minute lead only for Joaquin to level matters six minutes later.
  	Gerard Pique then restored the Catalan side's advantage ten minutes into the second half, but the home side again fought back with a goal from Roque Santa Cruz after 73 minutes.
  	However, late strikes from Andres Iniesta and Lionel Messi finally put the tie to bed with a 5-1 scoreline on the night.
